# Hello OWIN World
Hello World with OWIN

very simple app to play around with OWIN. 
Literally JUST hello world.

Steps:
1. BUILD IT (obviously!). This will pull the relevant nuget packages

2. command prompt into the project folder (hint, where the web.config sits)

3. run "../packages/OwinHost.3.0.1/tools/OwinHost.exe"

4. http://localhost:5000/

5. magix!



Enjoy.
